When I was young, my father told me that our people guided the universe to the correct path.
He said that as time passed, we and our technology evolved.
He explained how we cracked the secrets of space, time and all things.
We forged the vault to escape from our own universe to others.
We extracted quantum data from black holes, neutron stars and the foundations of creation.
We were gods.
We quickly transcended the Time Lords.
why? I asked.
He said that we are the laws of space, time and all things in the multiverse.
We transcended universes.
We will remain before space and after time.
We are Trasendiversa.
