# Trasendiversa

## Overview
I had to make my own conlang for one of my Final year University Modules 'LIN6203 Constructing a Language'. So, I decided to use Swift to make my life easier.

 A majority of my conlang 'Trasendiversa' is defined in Swift, from the phonetic inventory (vowels and consonants), phonotactics (syllable structure), Lexicon (words, affixes, tense morphemes etc). 
 
 I also have functions to make glossing easier like translating english to Trasendiversa, converting text to it's phonetic transcription, converting text to the writing system (just the English alphabet representation of it at least) and more.
